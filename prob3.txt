QUESTION: Why must a program be compiled for debugging? What two things do a compiler do to assist a debugger?

ANSWER: When a program is executed in the debugger, the compiler leaves the code exactly how is as opposed to optimizing it. This allows the programmer do see 
exact location of error. The second thing that is helpful is that the debugger can show variables at different times of the code. This can help with errors like 
dividing by zero.
