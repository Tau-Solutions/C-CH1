QUESTION: Name atleast two ways an IDE can assist over a generic text processor.

ANSWER: One way that IDE's can help are in the assistance of syntax. Certain IDE's will match braces and perform indentation for the programmer. Another way 
they can help is by giving a crash error. As opposed to having a program crash without any explanation, IDE's can give a basic error report to troubleshoot.
