QUESTION: You are tasked with writing a program that manages contact info. Program should save the first name, last name, and telephone num for 12 people. Give 
user option to add a a user, delete a user, update information, and display information. Describe the thought process of this project.

ANSWER: I don't know if array lists are a thing in striaght C; however, in order to combat array out of bounds errors, this would be the best option. From 
initialization, there could be three array lists set up. One for first name, one for last name, and one for phone numbers. These would all be Strings. The 
program then prompts the user for input to manipulate the arrays. For example, if input is equal to 1, the program will then know the user wants to add a 
customer. If array lists are not relevant, we can define the max size and fill the rest of the arrays with null string. If a user wants to add a user, it would 
write over the null strings and vice versa for deletion.
